This document is only a test, meant to practice git version control

It may be easier if I treat this like a journal. I can come back every so often and track my progress.

Cowboys lost the NFC Divisonal round of the playoffs a couple of hours ago. Offense was OK, could've played better. Defense got
shredded though. 275 yards on the ground versus Todd Gurley and CJ Anderson. Rooting for the Chargers to win it all.

Trying to practice with Git, have learned that if there are uncommitted changes in a branch you are working on that differ from
the one you are switching to, Git will not allow you to switch. Tried to get around this with sudo and it merged the branches for
me. Going to try committing first, switching, and then merging. Will push to github if successful.

Another test to see if I can do this correctly.
