This document is only a test, meant to practice git version control

It may be easier if I treat this like a journal. I can come back every so often and track my progress.

Cowboys lost the NFC Divisonal round of the playoffs a couple of hours ago. Offense was OK, could've played better. Defense got
shredded though. 275 yards on the ground versus Todd Gurley and CJ Anderson. Rooting for the Chargers to win it all.

Trying to practice with Git, have learned that if there are uncommitted changes in a branch you are working on that differ from
the one you are switching to, Git will not allow you to switch. Tried to get around this with sudo and it merged the branches for
me. Going to try committing first, switching, and then merging. Will push to github if successful.

Another test to see if I can do this correctly.

Went to Havana Rumba for Mom's bday, also took her to an escape room. Happened to be statistically the hardest one available and 
we escaped with less than 2 minutes left on the clock! Trying to get some final practice before I shadow tomorrow at work. Still working
with Git, going to go over flash cards and look over rest of document.

Checkout appears to work correctly now. Will now attempt to merge changes and push to github.

Shadowing went ok yesterday. Sounds like they are still holding out for perfect candidate, but still hope. Will continue to practice 
until further communication with Devin or HR. 

Have been playing Celeste. As difficult as I have heard it was. Nearly 600 deaths in 5 chapters. Will go back to collect more difficult
items and achievements.

*Master updated when switched to. Need to commit, then switch.
